### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Noel!
- I can code in p5.js and in Python, but I am learning how to code in html, CSS and JavaScript.
- My pronouns are they/them/theirs!
- I like to play video games like Town of Salem 2 and Minecraft.
- I'm currently working on making a portfolio for myself and learning at TKh through KKCF.
- Fun fact: I've traveled to 15 different countries and used to live in South Korea for 2 years!
